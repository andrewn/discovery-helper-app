MediaScape Discovery Helper
===

This Chrome App listens for radios on the local network using DNS-SD over mDNS. Services found are broadcast to the companion MediaScape Discovery Chrome Extension.

For detailed installation of all components see [discovery-audio-stream-controller](https://github.com/mediascape/discovery-audio-stream-controller/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

This is heavily based on the Chrome App [`mDNS browser` sample app](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/mdns-browser).
